<p>//Welcome</p>

<p>This toolbox is meant to be both simple and powerful by creating a GUI interface that allows you to interact with your data visually inside the MATLAB environment. On top of being able to manipulate your data with any of the built-in MATLAB functions, there are custom functions included in iEye designed specifically for analyzing and visualizing eye- movement data. However, there is nothing preventing this toolbox from being used for data beyond eye-movements. In fact, our lab also uses it for analyzing reach data in motion capture experiments.
We encourage you to also write your own custom functions for iEye and sharing them with the community. We will be doing the same by posting them on our GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/wemackey/iEye">https://github.com/wemackey/iEye</a>) and the NYU Curtis Lab website (<a href="http://clayspace.psych.nyu.edu/">http://clayspace.psych.nyu.edu/</a>).</p>

<p>//Installation</p>

<p>The installation process is rather straightforward. Of course, you must first have a working version of MATLAB installed on your computer. To get iEye working, just follow these simple steps:
1. Extract the contents of the compressed iEye archive to the directory of your choice.
2. Make sure the directory you extracted iEye to in step 1 is in your MATLAB path. If not, be sure to add it.
3. Just type “iEye” into the command window within MATLAB and the iEye interface will automatically load up.</p>

<p>That’s it! If for some reason those steps don’t seem to work, please check out the troubleshooting section of this user manual.</p>
