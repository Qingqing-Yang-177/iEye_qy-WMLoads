%II_CALIBRATEBYTRIAL Adjust gaze coords so that gaze is a known value at a
%known period of trial.
%   One selection expected per trial, and either channels, column indices
%   to ii_cfg.trialinfo, or n_trials length vectors, to which the full
%   trial timeseries is warped.
%   CALIB_MODE can be one of: 'rotate' or 'scale' - if rotate, chan_names
%   MUST be both X & Y; if scale, can be either one or both channels. [like
%   ii_driftcorrect.m, we also adjust all 'child' channels - those which
%   begin with chan_names{cc}_]
%   - scale: multiply channel values by
%     desired_chan_value/actual_chan_value independently
%   - rotate: convert to r, th, scale r and rotate th to achieve desired
%     coords
%
% Note: it's helpful to have run driftcorrect before this so that
% 'fixation' values are set to 0,0, and so scaling doesn't substantially
%  alter mean fixation
%
% May also make a calibrateacrosstrials.m version which applies similar
% polynomial fitting/adjustment as previous versions of iEye
% (ii_calibrateto.m). This version attempts to fix each trial individually
% without regard for stability across positions over a run.
